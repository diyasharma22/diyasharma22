## About Me

I’m an Electronics and Communication Engineering (ECE) student who enjoys building and experimenting with software projects. I like turning ideas into working applications and learning through hands-on coding rather than purely theoretical problem sets.

My current focus is on improving my programming skills in **C++ and JavaScript**, exploring practical applications through small projects, and understanding how software systems can be designed clearly and efficiently.

- **Learning:** Programming fundamentals, C++, JavaScript, and core software and hardware concepts  
- **Creating:** Web-based applications, mini-projects, and functional prototypes  
- **Aiming For:** Strong practical coding skills and readiness for software-focused internships
